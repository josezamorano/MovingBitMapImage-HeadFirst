This project contains the Bee section of the beehive simulator project from the book C# Head First.
In here the behavior of the bee is isolated from the rest of the project in order to facilitate 
the study of the movements of the bee. In here the bee moves randomly along a square area and when
it hits the borders, it randomly moves to some other direction. Later on, this section is integrated
with the Flowers section into the world project where the bees chase a target as well as they
have some free fly around the field when there are no flowers available. I hope this code is useful
to you and that you enjoy creating the simulator as much as I did. Thanks for all!.
